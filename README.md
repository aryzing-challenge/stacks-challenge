# Stacks Code Challenge

Thank you for taking the time to review this code challenge.

## Quick start

To get a development version of the app running on your local machine, use

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

The app has been built using Node.js v18.7.0 and Yarn 1.22.19, although it should work with any recent version of Node.js and a recent version of Yarn 1.

# Architecture

The app has been bootstrapped using Vite's Typescript template,

```bash
yarn create vite --template ts-react
```

which conveniently handles code bundling and application serving.
